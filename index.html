  <!-- About Section -->
  <div class="w3-content w3-justify w3-text-black w3-padding-32" id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <hr class="w3-opacity">
    <p>Prior to founding Lizzie Evans Global Media in 2024 as CEO and Director of Business, Lizzie held the position of CEO at both her former media companies - Online Media Tutor and Open Creations, leading to the formation of Lizzie Evans Global Media. 
</p>
<p>

Lizzie’s career in film, television and media began in 2006 and she has been affiliated with countless international production companies. She brings extensive expertise in international broadcasting and production, blending strong business acumen with creative vision. 
</p>
<p>

She is the only leader globally implementing a corporate strategy that secures long-term sustainability for production companies — saving millions today while preventing the risk of collapse, sell-offs to larger studios, or public backlash over lack of inclusivity in the next 10–20 years. By embedding cost-saving investment models and genuine inclusion, particularly for neurodivergent and disabled talent, she delivers a strategy that others view as impossible — but for her, it is remarkably simple and entirely achievable.
 </p>
<p>
<p>
Her focus is on bringing together the best creative minds in an environment built on collaboration, ensuring they produce the highest-quality work that audiences deserve — while also delivering greater profitability than traditional production models allow.
</p>
<p>
She works with major private clients to deliver international broadcasting, screenwriting, production, and direction that not only saves companies millions through streamlined, economically efficient productions, but also pioneers ethical hiring practices for neurodivergent and disabled talent both on and off screen. As the only professional globally implementing this patented model, she sets and executes business strategies that drive sustainable growth in the UK and worldwide, both organically and through acquisition.
</p>
<p>
As a CEO, businesswoman, screenwriter, producer, and director, she has successfully implemented corporate strategies to drive company investment, championed financially sustainable and ethical hiring practices, and delivered economically efficient business strategies.
</p>
<p>
Lizzie has an MA in Film, a BA Honours Degree in Film and Media and is a proud ally of the Neurodivergent and Disabled community.

<div class="w3-content w3-justify w3-text-black w3-padding-32" id="fee schedule">
    <h2>Fee Schedule</h2>
    <hr class="w3-opacity">

<p>My basic hourly rate is £350, but I try to work as much as possible on a “flat fee” basis so you know exactly where you stand. Whenever I have to charge an hourly rate (normally, anything that involves extensive drafting or negotiation), I will always give an estimate up front and in writing. If anything happens to cause me to increase my estimate, I will always let you know and get your approval BEFORE running up any additional time.</p>

<p>Please note that a minimum fee of £350 will be charged for preparing or reviewing any contract, correspondence, or other industry document. If the minimum fee applies to you, I will let you know before agreeing to undertake any consulting matter.</p>

<p>You will not incur fees until we both sign a written retainer agreement that spells out clearly (1) the services I will perform and (2) the fees I will charge. Flat fees are payable in advance and in full, and an advance retainer will normally be requested when I work on an hourly rate basis. However, if your change your mind and decide not to go through with a transaction before my work is completed, I don’t just “glom” the fee or retainer — instead, I total up the number of hours I have actually worked at £350 an hour, and rebate any excess to you promptly upon your request.</p>

<div class="w3-content w3-justify w3-text-black w3-padding-32" id="respose time">
    <h2>Response Time</h2>
    <hr class="w3-opacity">

<p>Every client is a priority client. I always respond to messages within 24 hours of receipt (and usually much sooner than that), and answer my e-mail messages at least once or twice a day, even when I’m on the road. I will always be up front with a client about any limitations on my schedule.</p>

<p>During major UK and US holidays — such as Christmas, Boxing Day, New Year’s, Easter, Thanksgiving, Independence Day, Memorial Day, and Labor Day — please allow about a week around those dates for me to respond.</p>
